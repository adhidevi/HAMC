PVDIS part is added to hamc

classes hamcExptPVDIS hamcPhyPVDIS hamcTgtPVDIS are almost copies from HAPPEX (or PREX)
except that fortran subroutines are linked in hamcPhyPVDIS



All fortran subroutines are from Xiaochao's package.
------------------------------------------------------
xsec.f is the function for calculating cross section, in which r1998.f is called.

getpdf_mrst2003.f is the main subroutine for asymmetry, in which the all the other fortran files are used.

directories ./pdffiles_11gev/ and ./pdffiles_6gev/ are needed to reduce running time sometimes.




Makefile
---------------------------------

PVDIS part is added

/usr/lib/libg2c.so.0 added to CXXFLAGS in order to link fortran to C++ 





Input File:  pvdis.dat. I copied most of the parameters from happex and chose some parameters by guessing:), so definitely need to check and adjust them!!!!




Presently pvdis seems to be working on technical level (can pass compilation and can be excuted), but not on the physical level. Will get Error messages such as "hamcSingles::ERROR:no counts ?" while excuted.



NOT DONE YET! JUST A STRUCTURE TO START WITH.
