     hamc  =  Hall  A  Monte  Carlo

     R. Michaels,  Jan 2009; updated Mar 2015

============================================================================

This is a single-arm Monte Carlo used by the parity experiments
in Hall A.  It was used by HAPPEX-III, PVDIS, PREX, anc C-REX.

For version control, I'm using github now.  (Formerly in CVS).  
A good way to proceed is to make your repository on github.com,
the Fork https://github.com/rwmichaels/hamc, then "git clone"
it to your local PC, and if you have useful changes you can 
make a "pull request" to me.

To proceed do the following


Compile:

    make clean
    make

Run

    ./prex    
or 
    ./happex
   (and don't forget the dot "." and slash "/")

Optional argument is the number of events, like this:

    ./prex 1000000

Histogram output

    hamc.root

To show some results, 

   root hamc.root
   root [7] .x ./macros/show4.C
   (etc)


I/O control of code

    prex.dat   to control prex
    happex.dat to control happex


Notes on Guido Transport (Mar 2009)

   An appropriate line in prex.dat:

hrs_setup coldseptum uselerose useguido

   LeRose functions produce xfoc,yfoc, etc and "inaccept".
   In ntuple you'll see Guido's new xgui,ygui,thgui,phgui 
   for transport variables at the focal plane.
   Impose the accepance cut from LeRose transport model
   and compare the variables.

Issues

   radcor numer is best for prex.
   genercone radiative tail is best for happex.
