     hamc  =  Hall  A  Monte  Carlo

     R. Michaels,  initial version Jan 2009; updated Jan 2018

============================================================================

This is a single-arm Monte Carlo used by the parity experiments
in Hall A.  It was used by HAPPEX-III, PVDIS, PREX, anc C-REX.

For version control, I'm using github.  
A good way to proceed is to make your repository on github.com,
the Fork https://github.com/rwmichaels/hamc, then "git clone"
it to your local PC, and if you have useful changes you can 
make a "pull request" to me.

To proceed do the following

Compile:

    make clean
    make

Run

    ./prex    
or 
    ./happex
   (and don't forget the dot "." and slash "/")

Optional argument is the number of events, like this:

    ./prex 1000000

Histogram output

    hamc.root

To show some results, 

   root hamc.root
   root [7] .x ./macros/show4.C
   (etc)


I/O control of code

    prex.dat   to control prex
    happex.dat to control happex

New in 2018 is the transport code THRSTrans.  The old fortran
code (LeRose functions) still exist but are effectively turned
off (USEFORTRAN flag in Makefile).
